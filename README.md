## .gitignore
The .gitignore in this repository has been optimised specifically for Unity. Compared to the publicaly available version:

- It excludes ALL Visual Studio-related remnants from the commit list, such as __*.csproj__ , __*.sln__ , etc.
- It excludes Font files that tend to take up a lot of allocation, such as __SDF.asset__ , etc.
- Of course, Temp, Library, __Streaming Assets__, __User Settings__ and other folders are also excluded.

## Editor
This folder contains files to be placed in Assets/Editor.

## GUI
Contained in the GUI folder are GUI-related assets.
