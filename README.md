# Unity-Tool-Box
A kit contains useful Unity tools.

## .gitignore
The .gitignore in this repository has been optimised specifically for Unity. Compared to the publicaly available version:

- It excludes Visual Studio-related remnants from the commit list, such as .csproj, .sln, etc.
- It excludes Font files that tend to take up a lot of allocation, such as SDF.asset, etc.
- Of course, Temp, Library and other folders are also excluded.

## Editor
This folder contains files to be placed in Assets/Editor.

## GUI
Contained in the GUI folder are GUI-related assets.
